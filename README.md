## Description 

> In this Project I had to replicate a responsive website. This website opens up with a great big "WELCOME" from there the view will select any of the options available on the Navigational bar which contains links that will redirected the viewer to an "About" section that briefly describes a little about myself. The second will be a "Portfolio" section that currently displays (place holders) which will soon will be filled with projects that will accumulate throughout my bootcamp program. Lastly a "Contact Me" section that the viewer has the ability to enter in their First/Last name, Email address, and a message that they can enter. Although there is a SUBMIT button - no immediate action takes place - as JavaScript functions are not currently active.

## Installation
